/* ðŸ”– Brand color is an alternative to the primary & the secondary color. Here, the type 1 is the primary color and the type 2 is the secondary color. I have made these brand color so that I can have more variations of primary and secondary color if I want. Moreover, here I have opposite_theme color which will be helpful when I want to use secondary color over a primary color or a primary color over a secondary color. 

In MUI, primary color has 3 variations: light, main & dark. So, I am also having 3 variations of brand color: v1, v2 & v3. v1 will represent light, v2 will represent main and v3 will represent dark. 

Instead of the name light, main and dark, I am having v1, v2 & v3 because I think that v=variation is actually making more sense. And in future, I can have v4 or v5, if I want.

/* ðŸ”– When you change the type 1 brand color, make sure to change the primary color and have the same color as the type 1 brand color. Similarly, When you change the type 2 brand color, make sure to change the secondary color and have the same color as the type 2 brand color.  */



/* ðŸ”– Color Review: 

cyan:  works really well with the dark mode but not that good with the light mode.  

deepOrange: works better in light mode but not bad in dark mode too. 

teal: works fine with both light and dark mode.
